## Project

Rental & Services Management System is a way for customers/people and the 
management (person who is renting/providing service) to interact in such a way that it 
simplifies and organizes tasks related to their property. The system should encompass 
functionalities including, but not limited to, different rental items such as apartments, 
cars, boats and services such as plumbing, pest control and so on. More specifics about 
the rental & services management details would be described in the feature page. Also 
the website should have different views for management and customers. The website 
should also provide the way of interacting with customers & management. Customers 
should be able to rate the rented items or services. 
For more details visit this website. Although this website contains a wide variety of 
options, you would be asked to build only some of the functionalities.
